# Book management app

This is an application that lets the user manage books by listing them and adding new ones.

To run the project, run `docker-compose up -d --build`. This will result in two containers being built and run, one for the React frontend and one for the Node.js backend. You can then navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.
