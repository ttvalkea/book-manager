# Book manager frontend

This is the frontend for the book manager app. It shows a list of books to the user and allows them to add new books.

The project only works when both the frontend and backend are running on the same machine. This is easiest to accomplish by running `docker-compose up -d --build` in project root (one folder level below this).
